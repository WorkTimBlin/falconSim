plan: split the autopilot in tactic and strategic modules, 
where the tactic module calculates the desired position 
for the next timeframe, given the long-term target position, 
and strategic, given the vehicle configuration and tactic 
module output, defines the way of achieving this position.

i should split the desired thrust os axis so i can more easely 
calculate the desired thrust at the moment.
